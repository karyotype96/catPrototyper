# catPrototyper

Firstly, this is intended entirely for prototyping the rules to cellular automata, so they can be viewed and played around with immediately instead of waiting for results in [catWeaver](https://github.com/cSquaerd/catWeaver). Because I don't want this to interfere with the catWeaver, I'm writing this in Processing instead of Python, though the actual structure of the automaton classes will not change.
